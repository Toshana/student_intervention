For explanatory purposes, they are easily visualized as flow charts. Decision trees support multi-output tasks and a single decision tree can be used for multiclass classification without employing a strategy like one-versus-all. They are eager learners and can predict relatively quickly once the model has been built. Decision trees also do not expect linear features and work well with or without them. According to the Decision Tree documentation on sklearn, the cost of predicting data is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree, they can handle both numerical and categorical data, the model can be validated using statistical tests, and they perform well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",

Additionally, efficient decision tree learning algorithms like ID3 are greedy and learn efficiently by making locally optimal decisions, but are not guaranteed to produce the globally optimal tree. According to the documentation on sklearn's decision tree implementation, they can be unstable because small variations in the data can result in a completely different tree and they create biased trees if some classes dominate.\n",

    "In Support Vector Machines, the optimization objective is to maximize the margin, i.e. the difference between the separating hyperplane and the training samples that are closest to this hyperplane. SVMs are popular because they can be easily kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems, making them effective in high dimensional spaces. This also allows the user to add domain knowledge via the kernel. Another useful property of support vector machines is that it has a single local minimum that is also the global  minimum. According to the documentation on SVMs in sklearn, they are effective in high-dimensional spaces, still effective when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples and uses a subset of training points making it very memory efficient.\n",

Additionally, non-linear SVMs have a training complexity between O(n^2) and O(n^3) where n is the number of training examples, therefore in situations where they is a large dataset SVMs will not be able to train on all the data leading to poor performance, despite having a lot of data. \n",

Additionally, the concepts or rules are that learned are learned by local approximation using simple procedures, thus adhering to Occam's Razor in that it prefers simpler models.

Care must be taken to remove irrelevant or correlated features as the nearest neighbour is easily misled by noisy features. This might also lead to overfitting the model.

All three of the models chosen have prediction and training times of under 0.5 seconds, however the KNN algorithm has the fastest training time and the Decision Tree algorithm has the fastest prediction time. The decision tree also had the lowest F1 score, hardly better than random guessing in fact as a model that predicts every student will pass will have a similar accuracy (0.67 based on the graduation score). The Support Vector Machines on the other hand, had the highest f1 scores on each iteration for both training and test data and also performed in under 0.5 seconds, making it the best performing algorithm of the three. Furthermore, the difference between the F1 score at 200 training observations and 300 is very small while the training time almost doubles.
